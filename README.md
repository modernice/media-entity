# Media-related Entities

This library provides basic implementations for media-related entities, such as
[image galleries](./gallery). Each entity implementation is provided in two
variants:

- a standard implementation that provides the functionality, and
- an event-sourced implementation that builds on top of
	[goes](https://github.com/modernice/goes).
